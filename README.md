# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze thousands of stocks with working code that is quick and efficient. 
## Results
'using images and examples of code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018 as well as the execution times of the original script and refactored script'
Examples of code: If Cells(I + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(I, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) Then tickerEndingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(I, 6).Value
tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
This code told the computer to automatically move onto the next set of stock tickers after finishing with previous set.
